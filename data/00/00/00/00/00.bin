  |   expansion's central feature is to utilize the day and night cycle     |
  |   and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a    |
  |   bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the     |
  |   perils and misadventures of the dark hours?                           |
  |                                                                         |
